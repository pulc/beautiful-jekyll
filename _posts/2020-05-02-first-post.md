This is my very first post on this new blog!
 
You are wondering (nobody reads this so nobody is wondering) why I am creating a website.
 
There are a few reasons: The biggest is probably attention-seeking. The excuse for that is the fact that I am looking for a job.
And I need to have a resum√© and some projects to showcase.
But I guess I just need attention. Altoguh, there are thoughts I would like to express. Also, I am writing this for myself (an online diary sort of). And I would like to enhance my English skills.
 
I didn't want to post anything more on Facebook. I deactivated the account and I will delete it eventually. Currently, I am just too lazy to download all the pictures. Facebook is evil, there are enough studies that prove what a bad influence it has on the users; especially on people like me who are prone to addictions. 
I hate Instagram mostly due to my experience with active users. It is also an attention-seeking website. I hate all the fakeness it includes and how people desperately try to present themselves in the best light possible. I also have enough experience with people destroying nice moments with making videos/taking pictures in order to create Instagram-ready content. I guess I would like to write an article about it separately as it bothers me more than it should.
 I also dislike Twitter due to its limits regarding tweet size.
 
Having a website does not make me any better in terms of attentio n-seeking and online validation. However, I feel I am not contributing to Facebook's data collecting and its mistreating and I have all the power to express myself in articles instead of pictures and videos.

 
As a strong introvert, I can express myself much better with writing instead of speaking. (not sure if it's an introvert personality treat or just my treat). Anyways, here it is, my blog. I expect myself to stop writing very soon but we will see if I can keep it up.
