I left Berlin and went back to Czechia.

I am completely aware of the fact that nobody is reading this. Nevertheless, I am sharing with the Internet the exciting news that I left Berlin. (I guess I am writing this for myself for the time when I will be evaluating my past decisions.)
There were several reasons why I did the decision and I will not mention all of them.

The fact is, I hated Berlin. I never really liked the city and I was constantly in a bad mood while dwelling there.
I made a tough decision to break up with my boyfriend. It was very difficult and complicated, and I will skip this matter. Since I quit my job at Pierburg and submitted my Bachelor’s Thesis, there was really nothing much to keep me in that city after that. I made several friends, however, I still have more back in Czechia. And I can visit Berlin anytime again. I completely agree with my therapist who described my condition in Berlin as a ‘passive resistance’. As I did not want to be at that city in the first place, I was never really able to motivate myself to become optimistic regarding the future, nor I wanted to settle down in any way in that city.

It has been one week now and I have almost no regrets about the decision of moving back. My motivation has been expanding since I got here.
Due to the current virus crisis, there were no cross-border connections. I went from Berlin to thecity of Weiden with 3 transfers carrying my 2 suitcases (one with a broken handle) and 2 big bags. It was awful. Fortunately, my parents picked me up there and drove me to Pilsen.

I am excited to be back and after over 5 long years and I actually look forward to the future. Haven't felt it for ages. I am planning to settle down in Prague, starting to look for a job and for an apartment right now. I am planning to write more about my time in Berlin, why I hated the city, and why I did not have a good time there.

For now, I am sad because of the breakup but thrilled to start a new life chapter. It was, after all, something I wanted the whole 5 years, to get back and spend time with my friends and family, even though the price for it was high.

I am also planning to write about my job hunt. So far, it seems to be much easier to get a job here. (Any recruiters here? Please [hire me](https://pulc.github.io/resume/))
