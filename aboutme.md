Yo! I am [Pavel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pavel).
 
I guess I want to proceed with my career as a developer. Therefore, I am supposed to have a website. Let's see how it goes.
 
## Who am I
 
Just another human dwelling in Berlin, socially awkward and struggling with becoming an adult, trying to make his degree in IT happen.
Made in Czechia, moved to Germany about 6 years ago. Never really liked it here but getting used to it.
 
You might be surprised by my lack of class, interests, motivation, or self-esteem. Even though I am annoyed most of the time, I’m nice and sometimes even fun. There are indeed some people who enjoy my company.
 
Emotionally not very well developed, but alcohol and dark humor make me not care about it much. I like dogs, please send me as many cure pictures as possible.
 
Probably INTJ, if you are into that stuff (but please don’t be, it’s irrelevant)
 
Currently accepting applications for a new job. When I am paid, I am quite hardworking. My motivation is the fear of failure. I’m easy to maintain, just give me some nice colleagues and a semi-challenging task and I will do just fine. Life is meaningless so whatever gives me some somehow sustainable amount of dopamine will be okay.
 
Besides being weird, I also enjoy human fun activities like traveling, music, taking pictures, playing PC games, friends, Youtube, Netflix, pubs, sport, etc. Usually not getting crazy about it.
 
I avoid responsibilities a lot and tend to overthink stuff. No, not the happiest guy on the planet. My therapist told me I should choose a different career. But let's prove him he's wrong.

If you don't like reading texts, here you have an original emoji-based list. I guess, this is how the youth communicates nowadays anyway.

## Music

Due to the lack of interesting things to write about me, I feel the need to mention my favorite music and films.

There will be a link with an article. So far, you can check my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5zgUin1sYKnlb27Z3SDg72?si=UVCtRG7VTOGsLHRxeRBuPQ). Spotify told me I was gender-fluid.

## Cinema

There will be also an article about my favorites movies and series. So far, you must be satisfied with a [link](https://www.csfd.cz/uzivatel/346166-pavelulc/hodnoceni/) to my ratings on a Czech film database.

## Art
![a picture](/assets/img/devart1.jpg)

I like drawing and painting. There will be a section with my work on the website. In the meantime, you can check my [Deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/pavelulc/gallery). Currently I dedicated myself to urban sketching.

We all love taking pictures. I am also a wannabe photographer. Let me share my [public album](https://goo.gl/photos/ts7oYheLEbxC66Za9) from my solo travel to Iran. 

##  Literature

Unfortunately, I haven't read much recently. You can check my book [database](https://www.databazeknih.cz/uzivatele/pavel-ulc-10432). (sorry, in Czech only, again)
Used to read phantasy as a teenager a lot, proceeded to non-fiction lately. 

##  Games

Surprisingly, I don't have a link to any database. Let me just list my all-time favorites. 

Grown up on the classics as Heroes of Might & Magic 3, Age of Empires, Transport Tycoon, Icewind Dale.
I was quite additcted to Plants vs Zombies 2 and Cities: Skylines.

Currently using my gaming laptop to play classical Tetris and [Picross](http://liouh.com/picross/).

I also need to mention board games. Bang! is awesome. I also want to get better are Space Alert.

##  Food

It's trendy nowadays to talk about food everywhere and share your creations. I don't care about food and eat pretty much everything.

##  Miscellaneous

I ate 31 dumplings once. I think it's the biggest accomplishment of my life so far.

Since 2009, I am studying at an online [Hogwarts](https://www.hogwarts.cz) school. I am not a very proud Hufflepuff. Used to be a perfect. Due to my sloppiness, however, I have never finished my OWLs.

I am a big Survivor fan. I definitely spent too much time on Reddit.

I am learning Russian. Hit me up if you want a language exchange.

I run a marathon under 3:30. I can give you some tips.


![Hint](/assets/img/responsibilities.png)

I can name all countries and recognize their flags. Also visited some (backpacking ftw). If you want to get challenged and lose your whole free time, visit [jetpunk](https://www.jetpunk.com/users/pavelulc).

I am a terrible singer but still going to Karaoke every week. Usually, I need to get drunk before.

I never managed to stop using 9gag. With about 30 minutes daily on average from the teenage weeks, my estimation is several weeks in net time. I don't know why I am mentioning it my site would give every 9gagger cancer.

I would like to find a group to play Dungeons & Dragons! 

Since I am sharing everything here for no reason, I could share my favorite porn. But I (maybe) have the decency and spare you that.
