Yo! I am [Pavel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pavel).
 
I created this website as a resum√© when I was applying for a job as an SW developer. I don't need this website anymore and it serves just like my testimony full of random confessions.

Are you interested in my weight? [Learn more](https://pulc.github.io/2020-05-02-my-weight/).
 
## Who am I
 
Just another human dwelling in Prague, socially awkward and struggling with becoming an adult. Made in Pilsen in Czechia, spent the last 5 years in Berlin, and moved back to Czechia recently. Currently enjoying life here, with mixed feelings regarding the time in Germany.
You might be surprised by my lack of class, interests, motivation, or self-esteem. Even though I am annoyed most of the time, I‚Äôm nice and sometimes even fun. There are indeed some people who enjoy my company. Still fixed to my high school friends, which make my life much better.
Emotionally not very well developed, but alcohol and dark humor make me not care about it much. I like dogs, please send me as many cure pictures as possible.
Probably INTJ, if you are into MBTI. (but please don‚Äôt be, it‚Äôs irrelevant)
Currently working as an information security architect. There used to be an article about my job prospect and motivation here but it's risky to leave it here. My job is the best. üò∂ I can be highly motivated if I am paid and appreciated accordingly, although my biggest motivation is the fear of failure. Life is meaningless so whatever gives me some somehow sustainable amount of dopamine will be okay.
Besides being weird, I also enjoy human fun activities like traveling, music, taking pictures, playing PC games, friends, YouTube, Netflix, pubs, sport, etc. Usually not getting crazy about it. Currently also into urban sketching, street workout, bridge, chess, and winter swimming.
 (more info [here](https://pulc.github.io/2021-01-30-new-hobbies/))
 
I avoid responsibilities a lot and tend to overthink stuff. Used to be depressed for a long time, currently, I am doing fine, being generally much more interested.

Here you can find my result of [Clifton strength assessment](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx) which my company paid for. As you cas see, I have not the best social skills but I am fine when it comes to strategic thinking.

If you don't like reading texts, here you have an original emoji-based list. I am afraid this is the future of human interaction anyway.

## Music

Due to the lack of interesting things to write about me, I feel the need to mention my favorite music and films.

There will be a link with an article. So far, you can check my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5zgUin1sYKnlb27Z3SDg72?si=UVCtRG7VTOGsLHRxeRBuPQ). Spotify told me I was gender-fluid.

## Cinema

There will be also an article about my favorites movies and series. So far, you must be satisfied with a [link](https://www.csfd.cz/uzivatel/346166-pavelulc/hodnoceni/) to my ratings on a Czech film database.

## Art
![a picture](/assets/img/devart1.jpg)

I like drawing and painting. There will be a section with my work on the website. In the meantime, you can check my [Deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/pavelulc/gallery). Currently, I dedicated myself to urban sketching.

We all love taking pictures. I am also a wannabe photographer. Let me share my [public album](https://goo.gl/photos/ts7oYheLEbxC66Za9) from my solo travel to Iran. 

##  Literature

Unfortunately, I haven't read much recently. You can check my book [database](https://www.databazeknih.cz/uzivatele/pavel-ulc-10432). (sorry, in Czech only, again)
Used to read phantasy as a teenager a lot, proceeded to non-fiction lately. 

##  Games

Surprisingly, I don't have a link to any database. Let me just list my all-time favorites. 

Grown up on the classics as Heroes of Might & Magic 3, Age of Empires, Transport Tycoon, Icewind Dale.
I was quite additcted to Plants vs Zombies 2 and Cities: Skylines.

Currently using my gaming laptop to play classical Tetris and [Picross](http://liouh.com/picross/).

I also need to mention board games. Bang! is awesome. I also want to get better are Space Alert.

##  Food

It's trendy nowadays to talk about food everywhere and share one's creations. I don't care about food and eat pretty much everything.

##  Miscellaneous

I ate 31 dumplings once. I think it's the biggest accomplishment of my life so far.

Since 2009, I am studying at an online [Hogwarts](https://www.hogwarts.cz) school. I am not a very proud Hufflepuff. Used to be a prefect. Due to my sloppiness, however, I have never finished my OWLs.

I am a big Survivor fan. I definitely spent too much time on Reddit.

I am learning Russian. Hit me up if you want a language exchange!

I run a marathon under 3:30. I can give you some tips.


![Hint](/assets/img/responsibilities.png)

I can name all countries and recognize their flags. Also visited some (backpacking ftw). If you want to get challenged and lose your whole free time, visit [jetpunk](https://www.jetpunk.com/users/pavelulc).

I am a terrible singer but still going to Karaoke every week. Usually, I need to get drunk before.

I never managed to stop using 9gag. With about 30 minutes daily on average from my early teenage years, my estimation of a wasted life is several weeks in net time. I don't know why I am mentioning it as my site would give every 9gagger cancer.

I would like to find a group to play Dungeons & Dragons! 

Since I am sharing everything here for no reason, I could share my favorite porn. But I (maybe) have the decency and spare you that.
